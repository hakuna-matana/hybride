## Webpack config for hybrid site 
##### (React app and landing page)

This config is for those sites whose main page is a static landing page, 
and the rest of the pages are a React application (single page application).

#### Technology stack
For landing page: 
- es6 modules
- scss

For spa:
- React
- Typescript
- Scss modules

Other things the webpack config does:
- starts the dev server
- include scss global variables and mixin
- add fonts/jpg/png/svg
- add favicon.ico
